# Project Overview

## Purpose

This project serves as a foundational base for Docker-enabled development projects. It implements rigorous documentation standards and follows a structured memory bank system.

## Core Components

* Memory Bank System
* Docker Configuration
* Markdown Standards Enforcement
* Project Documentation Structure
* Workspace Diagnostic Validation
* Contextual Heading Uniqueness

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Rules Matrix

* Heading Structure
  * Increment by one level only
  * Start at beginning of line
  * Surrounded by blank lines
  * Unique across all levels (MD024)
  * Contextually unique when needed

* List Formatting
  * Consistent indentation
  * Space after markers
  * Lists surrounded by blank lines

* Code Blocks
  * Language specified
  * Surrounded by blank lines
  * Consistent fence style

* General Formatting
  * No trailing spaces
  * No hard tabs
  * Single blank lines only
  * 80 character line length limit

* Links and References
  * No bare URLs
  * Valid fragments
  * Defined reference labels

* Naming and Text
  * Proper capitalization
  * Alt text for images
  * Consistent emphasis style

## Memory Bank Structure

The system maintains state through a hierarchical documentation structure:

1. Project Brief (Core Requirements)
2. Product Context (Purpose and Goals)
3. Active Context (Current State)
4. System Patterns (Architecture)
5. Technical Context (Stack Details)
6. Progress Status (Development State)

## Development Guidelines

This project enforces strict adherence to:

1. Documentation standards
2. Memory bank maintenance
3. Docker best practices
4. Systematic updates
5. Workspace diagnostic validation
   * Pre-tool validation checks
   * Post-tool validation verification
   * Zero-warnings policy
   * Contextual heading uniqueness
